You can use the pace to measure the intensity of your exercise. For example, the pace intensity level might look like this:

Light intensity/low intensity: Pace greater than 20 minutes per mile
Moderate intensity: pace between 16 and 20 minutes per mile
Medium intensity: Pace between 12 and 15 minutes per mile
Vigorous Intensity: Pace less than 12 minutes per mile

When buying sports underwear, women may encounter choices about the strength of their sports underwear. You can use the intensity of running exercise as a reference.

*Note: The source of the metrics is https://www.verywellfit.com/; there are many different metrics, of which the above is just one.
